# Body Measurement Predictor

This is an intelligent tool that predicts missing body measurements based on a few provided ones using machine learning. It is built for fashion tech applications.

## 💻 Features
- Predicts missing body measurements from known values
- Uses real measurement datasets
- Interactive web app (planned)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit (planned for web app)

## 📁 Project Structure
This is how the files and folders are (or will be) organized:

body-measurement-predictor/
├── data/               # Raw datasets (never modify directly)
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
├── models/             # Trained models (.pkl, .h5)
├── app/                # Web app code (Streamlit/Flask)
├── venv/               # Virtual environment (excluded via .gitignore)
├── README.md           # Project overview
└── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies


## 🧪 How to Run This Project
1. Open Command Prompt and go to this folder
2. Activate virtual environment: `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter lab`

## 🧠 Future Plans
- Build Streamlit-based web interface
- Use GANs to generate additional data
- Connect with virtual try-on and pattern drafting tools
